      { q: 'What is a good stream delay for live events?', a: 'For interactive streams (Q&A, gaming), aim for 2-5 seconds. For non-interactive broadcasts, 10-30 seconds is acceptable and allows for better quality through longer buffer times.' },
      { q: 'How does segment duration affect latency?', a: 'In HLS/DASH streaming, the player must download complete segments before playing them. Shorter segments (1-2s) reduce latency but may cause more buffering on slow connections. Longer segments (6-10s) are more reliable but add significant delay.' },

    faq: [
      { q: 'What is speaker coverage angle?', a: 'Coverage angle is the dispersion pattern of a speaker, measured where the SPL drops by 6dB from the on-axis level. Typical point-source speakers have 60-120° horizontal and 40-60° vertical coverage.' },
      { q: 'How do I calculate throw distance?', a: 'Throw distance is how far a speaker can project sound at a usable level. It depends on the speaker\'s sensitivity (dB SPL), power handling, and the acceptable SPL at the listening position.' },
      { q: 'How many speakers do I need?', a: 'Divide your venue\'s width by the coverage width at the listening distance. For example, if each speaker covers 10m wide at 15m distance and your venue is 30m wide, you need 3 speakers minimum.' },
      { q: 'What is the inverse square law?', a: 'Sound level drops by 6dB each time the distance doubles in free field. So if a speaker measures 100dB at 1m, it will be approximately 94dB at 2m, 88dB at 4m, and so on.' },
